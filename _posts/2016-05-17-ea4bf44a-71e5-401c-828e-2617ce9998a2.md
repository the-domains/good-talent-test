### Leon Richards - Director

I am the Founder of Good Talent a specialist recruitment company that delivers values based hiring for values led business. I have a deep passion for Sustainable Business, articulating the opportunities we face and supporting those organisations forging a path in this space. With over 17 years experience I am an expert in deploying all methodologies used in talent attraction & selection having delivered many successful assignments across a broad portfolio of clients in both the Private & Public sector. 

With Buddhadarma as a foundation my core interest is the exploration of business and entrepreneurship as a form of personal practice. Starting my career with boutique consultancy, I provided recruitment services to the Sales & Marketing arena progressing to become manager of the London operation. After 5 years I moved industries to the IT software sector selling Microsoft Accounting & Finance software to mid-sized corporates before moving back into the talent space with offline and online recruitment advertising market leader TMP/Monster. 

From here I took the opportunity as Managing Consultant to set up a brand new business unit with the leading professional services firm Tribal, integrating technology with traditional consulting to deliver a full life-cycle portfolio of recruitment services to the Public Sector across all functions. Prior to starting Good Talent I was, Manager - Recruiter Relationships, at Warwick Business School for 3 years. I provided Recruitment, Talent Management & Talent Attraction solutions to corporate recruiters and career coaching services to MBA, MSc and school Alumni. I have a BA Hons in Philosophy from University College London, an MBA from Aston Business School and am a BPS qualified assessor.
